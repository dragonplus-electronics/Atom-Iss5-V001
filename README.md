# Atom Iss5 Repro V001 (Near Replica
 This board is intended to be used as a replica Issue 5 board for the Acorn Atom.
 
 Although it is identical in most respects, including the aesthetics of the silkscreen etc, certain elements have been changed in order to facilitate sourcing/placement of certain components. These are listed below:
 
 ## Footprint Changes
   Links 1-3 & 6-7 have been modified so that they are joined using a 2.54mm pitch header, instead of non-standard length links of wire.
   
   SK1 - the power socket has been switched for a modern footprint. Suitable sockets are the Cliff FC681465 or the FC681478. The former will accept both 2.1mm and 2.5mm barrel jacks, whilst the latter will only accept 2.1mm barrel jacks.
   SK2 - this has been swapped for a modern DIN-7 socket footprint. These are readily available. One such example is: https://uk.farnell.com/pro-signal/psg03465/din-socket-pcb-7p/dp/1791759
